# Zero Operator Access — Trusted Actions Implementation

**Last Updated Date**: 2026-06-14

## Summary

Zero Operator Access (ZOA) Trusted Actions provide a mediated, auditable mechanism for executing predefined operational tasks on ROSA HCP v2 regional infrastructure without granting operators direct cluster access. All actions are dispatched via Maestro as ManifestWorks, executed as ephemeral Kubernetes Jobs, and produce artifacts stored in S3 with full audit trails in DynamoDB.

## Context

- **Problem Statement**: Operators currently require direct kubectl/AWS CLI access to diagnose and remediate cluster issues. This violates Zero Operator Access principles by creating persistent, unaudited access paths. We need a system that allows operational tasks to be executed exclusively through predefined, auditable channels.
- **Constraints**:
  - EKS Pod Identity allows only one IAM role per ServiceAccount per namespace
  - Maestro ManifestWork is the transport mechanism to target clusters (no direct network path from RC to MC)
  - ManifestWork `feedbackRules` status values are size-limited (~1KB per field, 128KB total via MQTT)
  - All output must be stored in S3 (not in ManifestWork status)
  - Must be FIPS-compliant for FedRAMP
- **Assumptions**:
  - Maestro Agent runs on both RC and MC clusters
  - Platform API is the single entry point for TA execution
  - ArgoCD manages infrastructure provisioning on both cluster types
  - TAs may move to their own repository in the future

## Design

### Separation of Concerns

| Concern                                                 | Owner               | Where                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Script logic + RBAC rules                               | TA author           | `argocd/config/regional-cluster/platform-api/ta-templates/`          |
| Job boilerplate (image, volumes, entrypoint, resources) | Platform/infra team | `zoa-job-config` ConfigMap in platform repo                          |
| Job generation logic                                    | Platform API code   | Go code reads template + config, builds ManifestWork                 |
| Infrastructure (namespace, SAs, Pod Identity)           | Platform/infra team | `zoa-jobs` Helm chart (`argocd/config/shared/zoa-jobs/`) + Terraform |

### TA Template Format (What Authors Write)

Each TA is a minimal YAML file with these core fields: `name`, `scope`, `type`, `description`, `authorization`, `params`, and `script`. Kube-scoped TAs also declare an `rbac` section.

```yaml
name: get_nodes
scope: kube-api
type: read
description: List or get nodes in the target cluster
authorization:
  approval: none
timeout_seconds: 300
params:
  - name: name
    required: false
    default: ""
    description: "Specific node name (omit to list all)"
  - name: node_selector
    required: false
    default: ""
    description: "Label selector to filter nodes"
  - name: verbose
    required: false
    default: "false"
    description: "Return full JSON output instead of compact summary"
rbac:
  cluster_scoped: true
  rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["nodes"]
      verbs: ["get", "list"]
script: |
  set -euo pipefail
  NAME_ARGS=()
  if [ -n "${PARAM_NAME:-}" ]; then
    NAME_ARGS=("${PARAM_NAME}")
  fi
  SELECTOR_ARGS=()
  if [ -n "${PARAM_NODE_SELECTOR:-}" ]; then
    SELECTOR_ARGS=(-l "${PARAM_NODE_SELECTOR}")
  fi
  kubectl get nodes ${NAME_ARGS[@]+"${NAME_ARGS[@]}"} ${SELECTOR_ARGS[@]+"${SELECTOR_ARGS[@]}"} -o json > /tmp/raw.json
  if jq -e '.kind | endswith("List")' /tmp/raw.json > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    cp /tmp/raw.json /tmp/list.json
  else
    jq '{items: [.]}' /tmp/raw.json > /tmp/list.json
  fi
  cp /tmp/list.json /artifacts/output.json
```

**Optional template fields:**

| Field                    | Default                   | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `authorization`          | `{approval: none}`        | Authorization policy. All current TAs use `approval: none`. Future structured policies will gate dispatch behind approvers. |
| `write_cooldown_seconds` | `0` (uses global default) | Per-TA write cooldown override                                                                                              |
| `dry_run_action`         | `""`                      | Read TA to execute when `dry_run: true` is set (write TAs only)                                                             |

**No Job, no ConfigMap, no volumes, no image** — Platform API generates all of that.

**AWS-scoped TA example** (no `rbac:` section — uses Pod Identity for AWS access):

```yaml
name: list_eks_clusters
scope: aws-api
type: read
description: List all EKS clusters in the target account region
authorization:
  approval: none
timeout_seconds: 300
script: |
  set -euo pipefail
  aws eks list-clusters --output json > /artifacts/output.json
  echo "EKS clusters listed successfully"
```

AWS-scoped TAs use static ServiceAccounts (`zoa-aws-read`, `zoa-aws-write`) with Pod Identity. The scope value `aws-api` routes to the appropriate static SA — no per-execution SA is created.

**Parameter handling:**

- Each param becomes an environment variable in the Job: `PARAM_<UPPER_NAME>` (e.g., `PARAM_NODE_SELECTOR`)
- Platform API validates required params before dispatch
- Scripts access params via env vars
- All `get_*` read TAs accept an optional `name` parameter to fetch a single resource; response is normalized to list format (single item in array). Cannot be combined with `all_namespaces=true`. Cluster-scoped resources (`get_nodes`, `get_namespaces`, `get_pvs`) also support `name`
- Write TAs use a standardized `name` parameter (e.g. `rollout_restart`, `delete_pod`)

**Timeout:**

- Each TA can specify `timeout_seconds` (optional) for a per-action timeout override
- Global default is set via `execution_timeout_seconds` in `zoa-job-config` ConfigMap (default: 1800s / 30 min)
- Read TAs typically use 300s (5 min); write TAs 600s (10 min)

**Output convention:**

- Scripts MUST write structured output to `/artifacts/output.json` (JSON format, machine-parseable)
- All output (stdout + stderr interleaved) is captured to `execution.log` via `tee` in the entrypoint
- The uploader Job reads the output ConfigMap and uploads `execution.log` and `output.json` to S3
- Write TAs SHOULD include `affected_resources` in output.json for audit:
  ```json
  {
    "affected_resources": [
      {
        "kind": "Pod",
        "namespace": "maestro",
        "name": "maestro-xyz",
        "action": "deleted"
      }
    ],
    "summary": "Pod replaced successfully, controller will recreate"
  }
  ```

**Safety checks (required for write TAs):**

Write TAs MUST validate preconditions before acting. Platform API does not have direct access to the target cluster, so validation happens within the script:

```bash
# Example: refuse to delete standalone pod (no controller to recreate it)
OWNERS=$(kubectl get pod "${PARAM_NAME}" -n "${PARAM_NAMESPACE}" -o jsonpath='{.metadata.ownerReferences}')
if [ "$OWNERS" = "null" ] || [ -z "$OWNERS" ]; then
  echo '{"error": "Pod has no owner references, refusing to delete standalone pod"}' > /artifacts/output.json
  exit 1
fi
```

### What Platform API Generates (Per Execution)

From a minimal TA template, Platform API dynamically creates a ManifestWork containing:

1. **ServiceAccount** — per-execution `zoa-runner-<exec-id>`
2. **Role/ClusterRole** — from `rbac.rules` section
3. **RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding** — binding the runner SA to the role
4. **Output ConfigMap** — `zoa-output-<exec-id>` for inter-job transfer
5. **Output RBAC** — allows runner SA to patch the output ConfigMap
6. **Uploader RBAC** — dynamic `Role`/`RoleBinding` (`zoa-uploader-<exec-id>`) scoped via `resourceNames`
7. **Script ConfigMap** — entrypoint wrapper + TA script
8. **Runner Job** — executes TA, writes output to ConfigMap
9. **Uploader Job** — reads ConfigMap, uploads to S3

All generated resources carry rich labels for audit tracing:

```yaml
labels:
  zoa.rosa.io/execution-id: "abc-123"
  zoa.rosa.io/action: "get_nodes"
  zoa.rosa.io/operator: "slopezma"
  zoa.rosa.io/profile: "kube"
  zoa.rosa.io/type: "read"
  zoa.rosa.io/scope: "kube-api"
  zoa.rosa.io/target-cluster: "mc-useast1-1"
  zoa.rosa.io/revision: "a1b2c3d"
  zoa.rosa.io/managed: "true"
annotations:
  zoa.rosa.io/created-at: "2026-06-08T12:00:00Z"
```

The `revision` label tracks which Git commit of the TA definition was used — stored in DynamoDB AND on every created resource.

### Job Boilerplate Configuration

Managed via a ConfigMap (`zoa-job-config`) in the platform repo, NOT hardcoded in API code. The ConfigMap contains scalar configuration fields plus two embedded wrapper scripts (`entrypoint.sh` and `upload_entrypoint.sh`).

Source: [`argocd/config/regional-cluster/platform-api/templates/zoa-job-config-configmap.yaml`](../../argocd/config/regional-cluster/platform-api/templates/zoa-job-config-configmap.yaml)

**Configuration fields:**

| Field                            | Default          | Purpose                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `image`                          | (required)       | `zoa-tools` container image                              |
| `revision`                       | (injected)       | ArgoCD `git_revision` for traceability                   |
| `cpu_request` / `memory_request` | `25m` / `64Mi`   | Runner + uploader resource requests                      |
| `cpu_limit` / `memory_limit`     | `250m` / `256Mi` | Runner + uploader resource limits                        |
| `ttl_seconds`                    | `3600`           | Kubernetes Job `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` (backup GC)     |
| `execution_timeout_seconds`      | `1800`           | Global default execution timeout                         |
| `upload_timeout_seconds`         | `120`            | Reserved time budget for S3 upload after runner finishes |
| `write_cooldown_seconds`         | `300`            | Global write cooldown between same action on same target |
| `max_concurrent_per_target`      | `10`             | Max active (running + pending) executions per target     |
| `dynamodb_ttl_days`              | `365`            | DynamoDB record retention for execution and audit tables |
| `entrypoint.sh`                  | (script)         | Runner wrapper: captures output, patches ConfigMap       |
| `upload_entrypoint.sh`           | (script)         | Uploader wrapper: waits for runner, uploads to S3        |

**Design Rationale**:

The `zoa-job-config` ConfigMap serves as the centralized source of truth for all Job-level configuration. Key design decisions:

- **Wrapper scripts (`entrypoint.sh`, `upload_entrypoint.sh`)**: Embedded in the ConfigMap rather than baked into the container image. This allows hotfixing execution behavior (e.g., output capture, logging format) without rebuilding the `zoa-tools` image.
- **Base64 encoding for inter-job transfer**: The runner Job writes `execution.log` and `output.json` to the output ConfigMap as `binaryData` (base64-encoded). This avoids YAML escaping issues with arbitrary script output while staying within Kubernetes API limits (~10-15k lines of output).
- **Two-job parallel dispatch**: Both runner and uploader Jobs are created simultaneously in the same ManifestWork to avoid time overhead. The uploader starts immediately and polls the runner Job status every 1s (checking for `Complete` or `Failed` conditions). This detects runner failure in ~1s with no wasted wait time. Once the runner finishes, the uploader reads the output ConfigMap and uploads artifacts to S3. This parallel creation eliminates sequential dispatch latency — the uploader is already scheduled and waiting by the time the runner finishes. Each Job uses its own ServiceAccount, which also avoids shared permission leakage between execution and upload concerns.
- **Exit code preservation**: The runner captures `PIPESTATUS[0]` from the TA script and propagates it both to the ConfigMap (for the uploader/reconciler) and as the container exit code (for Kubernetes Job status). Crucially, the ConfigMap patch happens _before_ the runner exits — so even when the TA script fails, the output and logs are still written to the ConfigMap and subsequently uploaded to S3, making debugging of failed TAs straightforward.
- **Stdout + stderr capture**: All script output is captured via `tee` to `/artifacts/execution.log`, ensuring the full execution trace is available in S3 even if the runner Pod is garbage-collected.
- **ConfigMap checksum annotation**: The Platform API Deployment uses a checksum of the `zoa-job-config` ConfigMap content as a pod annotation. When the ConfigMap changes (e.g., new image version, updated entrypoint), ArgoCD detects the annotation change and triggers a rolling update of the API pods, which then hot-reload the new config on startup.
- **`dynamodb_ttl_days`**: Controls DynamoDB record retention for both execution and audit tables. Configurable without image rebuild (default: 365 days for FedRAMP compliance).

TA authors can optionally override resources for heavy tasks:

```yaml
name: must_gather
resources:
  cpu: "1"
  memory: "2Gi"
script: |
  ...heavy script...
```

### Cleanup and Lifecycle

Cleanup is **reconciler-driven**, not purely TTL-based:

1. **On terminal status (succeeded, failed, timed_out)**: The Platform API reconciler deletes the ResourceBundle from Maestro via gRPC. Maestro Agent cascades deletion to all resources on the target cluster (Job, Pod, ConfigMap, RBAC).
2. **Race-safe ordering**: ResourceBundle is deleted BEFORE DynamoDB status is updated. If RB deletion fails, status stays `pending`/`running` and the reconciler retries on the next tick.
3. **TTL as safety net**: Jobs have `ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600` (1h) as backup GC in case reconciler fails to clean up.
4. **Logs survive cleanup**: The uploader Job uploads `execution.log` to S3 before resources are deleted, so troubleshooting data is available via the API even after the Pod/Job is garbage-collected.

Static ServiceAccounts (`zoa-uploader`, `zoa-aws-read`, `zoa-aws-write`) are infrastructure managed by the `zoa-jobs` chart and are never deleted. Per-execution runner SAs and all other ManifestWork resources are removed on completion.

### Service Account Strategy — Two-Job Split

ZOA uses a split SA model separating operational permissions from output transport (see [Dispatch Flow](#dispatch-flow-two-job-architecture) for the full network diagram):

| ServiceAccount         | Lifecycle               | Kubernetes Access                                    | AWS Access (Pod Identity)                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `zoa-runner-<exec-id>` | Per-execution (dynamic) | Per-execution Role only                              | **None**                                  |
| `zoa-uploader`         | Static (infra)          | Per-execution Role (dynamic, `resourceNames`-scoped) | `s3:PutObject` + `kms:Encrypt`            |
| `zoa-aws-read`         | Static (infra)          | Per-execution Role                                   | AWS read-only APIs (no S3 on ZOA bucket)  |
| `zoa-aws-write`        | Static (infra)          | Per-execution Role                                   | AWS read-write APIs (no S3 on ZOA bucket) |

**Key design decisions:**

1. **Per-execution SA for kube TAs**: `zoa-runner-<exec-id>` is created dynamically in the ManifestWork. No Pod Identity — perfect K8s audit attribution.
2. **Static SAs for AWS TAs**: `zoa-aws-read` and `zoa-aws-write` require pre-provisioned Pod Identity. They have **no access to the ZOA S3 bucket**.
3. **Dedicated uploader SA**: Only `zoa-uploader` can write to S3. Uploader Kubernetes RBAC is generated dynamically per execution in the ManifestWork, scoped with `resourceNames` to the specific output ConfigMap and runner Job.
4. **No SA has both**: No single SA has both operational permissions AND S3 write access.

**Audit chain:**

| Layer                               | What's Recorded                                                                                                            | Identifies                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Platform API (DynamoDB executions)  | `execution_id`, `operator`, `jira`, `action`, `target`, `params`, `revision`, `updated_at`, `dry_run`, `force`, timestamps | Who requested what, when, why (Jira), and how (dry-run/forced) |
| Platform API (DynamoDB audit table) | `method`, `path` (full URI), `action`, `target_cluster`, `execution_id`, `jira`, `operator`, `status_code`, `timestamp`    | Every API call (including reads and rejections)                |
| ManifestWork + all resources        | Labels: `zoa.rosa.io/execution-id`, `zoa.rosa.io/operator`, `zoa.rosa.io/action`, `zoa.rosa.io/revision`                   | Full traceability on every K8s resource                        |
| Kubernetes audit logs               | Per-execution SA name (`zoa-runner-<exec-id>`) + pod labels                                                                | Perfect execution-level attribution                            |
| S3 object metadata                  | `x-amz-meta-execution-id`, `x-amz-meta-operator`                                                                           | Output ownership                                               |

### Namespace and Infrastructure Pre-creation

Infrastructure is deployed via the `zoa-jobs` Helm chart at `argocd/config/shared/zoa-jobs/`. The root ArgoCD ApplicationSet discovers shared charts and deploys them to both Regional and Management clusters with `CreateNamespace=true`.

| Cluster Type | Mechanism                         | What's Created                                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| RC           | ApplicationSet → `zoa-jobs` chart | Namespace `zoa-jobs`, static SAs                    |
| MC           | ApplicationSet → `zoa-jobs` chart | Namespace `zoa-jobs`, static SAs (execution target) |

ManifestWork is used **only** as transport for TA executions (Job + per-execution RBAC + ConfigMap).

### Job Image

A custom "swiss knife" image built for ZOA jobs, based on UBI9 for FIPS compliance:

**Base**: `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal`

**Included tools:**

| Tool      | Source           | Purpose                        |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `kubectl` | OpenShift mirror | Kubernetes API operations      |
| `oc`      | OpenShift mirror | OpenShift-specific operations  |
| `aws`     | AWS CLI v2       | AWS API operations + S3 upload |
| `jq`      | UBI package      | JSON processing                |
| `yq`      | GitHub release   | YAML processing                |
| `python3` | UBI package      | Complex scripting              |
| `bash`    | UBI package      | Shell scripting                |
| `curl`    | UBI package      | HTTP operations                |

**Image source**: [`rosa-hyperfleet-zoa`](https://github.com/openshift-online/rosa-hyperfleet-zoa) repository (`Containerfile`).

**Image location**: `quay.io/slopezz/zoa-tools:<pinned-tag>` (development), future: `quay.io/redhat-rosa/zoa-tools:<version>`

**Reference**: The `openshift/managed-scripts` Dockerfile (`quay.io/app-sre/managed-scripts`) uses a similar pattern with UBI8.

### API Design

#### Endpoints

| Method | Path                                   | Description                                            | Audited |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `POST` | `/api/v0/trusted-actions/{action}/run` | Execute a Trusted Action                               | Yes     |
| `GET`  | `/api/v0/trusted-actions/runs/{id}`    | Get execution                                          | Yes     |
| `GET`  | `/api/v0/trusted-actions/runs`         | List executions (paginated)                            | Yes     |
| `GET`  | `/api/v0/trusted-actions/audit`        | List API call audit log (paginated)                    | Yes     |
| `GET`  | `/api/v0/trusted-actions`              | List available TAs (catalog)                           | No      |
| `GET`  | `/api/v0/trusted-actions/{action}`     | Describe a specific TA (params, description, metadata) | No      |

`POST /{action}/run` returns **202 Accepted** with `{id, status: "pending"}` — execution is asynchronous. The CLI polls until terminal status unless `--no-wait` is set.

#### Create Request Body

All `POST /trusted-actions/{action}/run` calls require a `jira` field:

```json
{
  "target_cluster": "mc-useast1-1",
  "jira": "ROSAENG-1234",
  "params": { "namespace": "maestro", "name": "maestro-abc-123" },
  "force": false,
  "dry_run": false
}
```

| Field            | Required | Description                                                     |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `target_cluster` | Yes      | Target management cluster                                       |
| `jira`           | Yes      | Jira ticket (stored in DynamoDB, returned in execution records) |

#### Query Parameters for GET /runs/{id}

Uses an `include` parameter for selecting response content:

| Request                              | Returns                          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `GET /runs/{id}`                     | metadata only (default)          |
| `GET /runs/{id}?include=output`      | metadata + output                |
| `GET /runs/{id}?include=logs`        | metadata + execution.log content |
| `GET /runs/{id}?include=output,logs` | metadata + output + logs         |

The API proxies S3 content directly — no presigned URLs exposed to consumers.

#### Parameter Validation Errors

When a request includes unknown params, the API returns HTTP 400 with contextual messages:

- No params defined: `unknown parameter 'X'; this action accepts no parameters`
- With params defined: `unknown parameter 'X'; allowed parameters: a, b, c`
- Top-level field passed as param: appends `('X' is a top-level request field, not a param)`

  "dry_run_action": "",
  "params": [
    { "name": "name", "required": true, "description": "EKS cluster name" }
  ]
}
```

### Available Trusted Actions

The source of truth for available TAs is the TA template directory:
`argocd/config/regional-cluster/platform-api/ta-templates/`

Each YAML file defines one TA. Use `zoa actions` (CLI) or `GET /trusted-actions` (API) to list the current catalog at runtime.

### CLI Design

Designed around SRE muscle memory — mirrors `kubectl`/`oc` patterns with familiar flags.
Implementation: [`rosa-hyperfleet-zoa`](https://github.com/openshift-online/rosa-hyperfleet-zoa) — a standalone Go CLI (`zoa`) with built-in SigV4 authentication, polling, and formatted output.

#### Setup

```bash
# Install (requires Go 1.25+)
go install github.com/openshift-online/rosa-hyperfleet-zoa/cmd/zoa@latest

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/openshift-online/rosa-hyperfleet-zoa.git
cd rosa-hyperfleet-zoa && make build   # binary at ./bin/zoa

# Load AWS credentials for your environment
eval "$(aws configure export-credentials --format env --profile <your-profile>)"

# Set the API Gateway URL for your region
export API_URL="https://<api-gateway-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod"
```

#### Command Structure

```
zoa <verb> [resource] [flags]
```

**Polling interval:** 5 seconds (CLI default when waiting for execution completion).

**Table columns:**

- `zoa runs`: `CREATED_AT`, `OPERATOR`, `ID`, `ACTION`, `PARAMS`, `TARGET`, `SCOPE`, `TYPE`, `STATUS`, `OUTPUT`, `RUN`, `UPL`, `TOT`
- `zoa audit`: `TIMESTAMP`, `METHOD`, `CODE`, `OPERATOR`, `ACTION`, `TARGET`, `JIRA`, `APPROVAL`, `EXEC_ID`, `PATH`

**Global flag:** `-o json` on any command returns raw JSON instead of formatted output.

**ID Format**: Execution IDs are standard UUID v4 (e.g., `fa65418c-f4eb-4f5c-8314-baaeb695ba7d`).
Full UUIDs are required for `get`, `logs`, and other ID-based operations. The `✓ <id>`
confirmation on stderr shows the full UUID — copy-paste from `zoa runs` output.

#### Run Flags (mirrors kubectl)

| Flag                     | Param                 | Description                                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-t, --target <cluster>` | `target_cluster`      | Target cluster (**required**)                                      |
| `--jira <ticket>`        | `jira`                | Jira ticket (**required**, e.g. `ROSAENG-1234`)                    |
| `-n <namespace>`         | `namespace`           | Namespace                                                          |
| `-A`                     | `all_namespaces=true` | All namespaces                                                     |
| `-l <selector>`          | `label_selector`      | Label selector (kubectl `-l` syntax)                               |
| `-v, --verbose`          | `verbose=true`        | Full JSON output (no compact)                                      |
| `--resource <type>`      | `resource`            | Resource type (for `get_resource`)                                 |
| `--name <name>`          | `name`                | Resource name (read TAs: single fetch; write TAs: target resource) |
| `--force`                | `force=true`          | Bypass write cooldown                                              |
| `--dry-run`              | `dry_run=true`        | Execute `dry_run_action` instead (preview)                         |
| `--no-wait`              | —                     | Don't poll; return ID immediately                                  |
| `--param key=value`      | arbitrary             | Pass any param not covered by flags                                |

#### Output Contract

- **stderr**: Progress/status messages (`✓`, `✗`, timing breakdown) — human feedback
- **stdout**: Pure JSON for `zoa run` output — pipeable to `jq`, scripts, or files
- **Human-readable modes**: `zoa get <id>` (metadata), `zoa get <id> --output` (metadata + output), `zoa describe <action>`, and `zoa runs` show formatted summaries; use `-o json` for raw JSON

Timing display format on completion:

```
total=22s (runner=5s upload=12s dispatch=5s)
```

This means `zoa run ... | jq '...'` always works cleanly for run output.

#### Typical SRE Session

```bash
# 1. What can I do?
$ zoa actions
$ zoa describe get_pods

# 2. Run and see result immediately (synchronous — polls until done)
$ zoa run get_nodes -t eph-bc5fee45-mc01 --jira ROSAENG-1234
✓ fa65418c-f4eb-4f5c-8314-baaeb695ba7d        # full UUID (stderr)
✓ completed (total=22s (runner=5s upload=12s dispatch=5s))  # timing breakdown (stderr)
[                                             # output (stdout)
  {"name": "ip-10-0-1-15.ec2.internal", "status": "Ready", "roles": "worker", "age": "45d", ...},
  {"name": "ip-10-0-2-88.ec2.internal", "status": "Ready", "roles": "worker", "age": "45d", ...}
]

# 3. Fetch a single resource by name
$ zoa run get_pods -t eph-bc5fee45-mc01 -n maestro --name maestro-abc-123 --jira ROSAENG-1234

# 4. Pipe to jq for further filtering
$ zoa run get_pods -t eph-bc5fee45-mc01 -A --jira ROSAENG-1234 | jq '.[] | select(.restarts > 5)'
$ zoa run get_pods -t eph-bc5fee45-mc01 -A --jira ROSAENG-1234 | jq '.[] | select(.status != "Running")'

#### Design Principles

- **`run` is synchronous**: Submit → poll → print output. Like `kubectl exec`, not `kubectl apply`.
  On failure, logs are printed automatically — no second command needed to see the error.
- **`--jira` is always required**: Every execution must be linked to a Jira ticket for audit.
- **`--no-wait` for background**: Long tasks (must-gather) can run async; check later with `zoa get`.
- **`get` = metadata, `get --output` = metadata + output, `logs` = trace**: Human-readable by default; `-o json` for raw JSON.
- **`-t` is always required**: No hidden defaults — explicit target prevents wrong-cluster mistakes.
- **Flags match kubectl**: `-n`, `-A`, `-l`, `--name` behave identically to muscle-memory expectations.
- **stdout/stderr contract**: JSON on stdout for `zoa run` (pipeable), status/progress on stderr (human-only).
- **Write safety**: `--dry-run` previews via `dry_run_action`; `--force` bypasses write cooldown and max concurrent.
- **UUID v4**: IDs are standard UUID v4 (`google/uuid`). Full IDs required for lookups —
  copy-paste from `zoa runs` output.
- **Compact by default**: Read TAs return kubectl-wide-equivalent fields; pass `-v` for full objects.
- **Time-scoped history**: `--since` prevents information overload during incidents.
- **`API_URL` env var**: No hardcoded URLs. Set once per session/profile.
- **Bare verbs for TAs, prefixed for breakglass**: TAs are the hot path; `breakglass` is the escalation
  path and deliberately requires more typing (see breakglass section).

### Rate Limiting and Safety Controls

#### Write Cooldown

- Global default: 300s (via `write_cooldown_seconds` in `zoa-job-config` ConfigMap)
- Per-TA override: `write_cooldown_seconds` in template YAML (e.g. `delete_pod`: 60s, `rollout_restart`: 300s)
- Bypass: `force: true` in API request, `--force` in CLI
- Returns HTTP 429 with `write-cooldown` error when active
- Not enforced for dry-run requests

#### Max Concurrent Per Target

- Global default: 10 (via `max_concurrent_per_target` in `zoa-job-config` ConfigMap)
- Counts running + pending executions for the target cluster (per account)
- Dry-run executions are excluded from the check
- Bypass: `force: true` in API request, `--force` in CLI (same as write cooldown)
- Returns HTTP 429 with `max-concurrent` error when limit reached

#### Dry-Run Preview

Write TAs can specify `dry_run_action` (name of a read TA):

```yaml
name: rollout_restart
dry_run_action: get_deployments
```

When `dry_run: true` is set, Platform API executes the referenced read TA instead. The execution record stores:

- `action`: the originally requested action (e.g. `rollout_restart`)
- `executed_action`: the substituted read action (e.g. `get_deployments`)
- `dry_run: true`

CLI displays: `✓ <id> (DRY-RUN: rollout_restart → get_deployments)`

#### Force Bypass

The `force: true` flag bypasses both write cooldown and max concurrent checks:

- CLI: `--force` flag
- API: `"force": true` in request body
- The `force` flag is recorded in the execution record for audit
- Queryable: `zoa runs --force` or `GET /runs?force=true`
- CLI displays: `✓ <id> [FORCED]`

### TA Versioning

- TAs are stored in `argocd/config/regional-cluster/platform-api/ta-templates/`, packed into a ConfigMap, and mounted into Platform API
- Every execution records the `revision` (Git SHA) of the TA used in DynamoDB and on all K8s resources
- Platform admins control which revision is active per environment via ArgoCD sync

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Per-execution ServiceAccount with dynamic Pod Identity**: Each TA execution creates its own SA and wires Pod Identity dynamically. Rejected because EKS Pod Identity requires Terraform/API calls per SA (cannot be done from within a ManifestWork), adding minutes of latency and significant IAM complexity.

2. **Single shared ServiceAccount**: One SA (`zoa-job-runner`) for all TAs. Rejected because Kubernetes audit logs only show SA identity — all TAs would be indistinguishable at the K8s audit level. Additionally, a shared SA bound to N possible Roles means parallel executions share permissions — any running TA would have access to RBAC granted for a different concurrent TA.

3. **IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)**: Allows per-SA roles via annotations. Rejected because IRSA is being deprecated in favor of EKS Pod Identity, which does not require OIDC provider management per cluster and is the platform-standard auth mechanism for workload SAs.

4. **Sidecar container for S3 upload**: A separate container watches `/artifacts` and uploads. Rejected because sidecars add complexity around container ordering and completion detection. Additionally, containers in the same Pod share the same ServiceAccount — the runner would inherit S3 write permissions, breaking the isolation between operational actions and output transport.

5. **Full ManifestWork templates (Job + RBAC defined by TA author)**: TA authors define the entire ManifestWork content including Job spec. Rejected because it couples boilerplate (image, volumes, resources, entrypoint) to each TA, requiring all TAs to be updated when infrastructure changes (e.g., image bump).

## Design Rationale

- **Justification**: The split SA model (per-execution runner + static uploader/AWS SAs) balances auditability, operational simplicity, and Pod Identity constraints. Separating TA authoring (script + RBAC) from execution boilerplate (image, wrapper, resources) enables independent evolution of each concern.
- **Evidence**: Maestro is the current transport layer for ManifestWork dispatch across ROSA HCP v2 (hyperfleet), ARO-HCP, and GCP-HCP — a proven mechanism at scale. The `openshift/managed-scripts` project validates the "swiss knife image + script" pattern for OSD/ROSA operations.
- **Comparison**: Per-execution runner SAs provide execution-level K8s audit attribution. Static AWS and uploader SAs satisfy Pod Identity constraints while keeping IAM association count bounded. Rich labels on all resources enable correlation via kube audit logs.

## Consequences

### Positive

- TA authors write ~15 lines of YAML (name + rbac + script) — no boilerplate
- Split SA model keeps operational and transport permissions isolated
- Image, entrypoint, and resources managed centrally — single place to update
- Full audit trail across DynamoDB + S3 + K8s resources (labels on everything), including required Jira ticket
- Git revision tracked on every resource and in DynamoDB
- DynamoDB TTL auto-expires execution records after 365 days (aligned with S3 retention)
- Write cooldown and max-concurrent limits prevent accidental target overload
- Dry-run preview for write TAs via `dry_run_action`
- No infrastructure changes required when adding new TAs
- API proxies S3 content — clean consumer experience, no presigned URL leakage
- CLI follows kubectl/oc patterns — zero learning curve for SREs

### Negative

- Custom image requires maintenance (updates, CVE patches, FIPS recertification)
- 1MB ConfigMap limit constrains inter-job output transfer size (~10-15k lines of JSON — more than sufficient for operational queries)

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Security:

- All SAs have minimal AWS permissions scoped to their profile
- Per-TA Roles/RoleBindings enforce least-privilege at the Kubernetes API level
- S3 bucket uses KMS encryption at rest
- DynamoDB uses KMS encryption at rest with 365-day TTL auto-expiry
- Jobs run with `runAsNonRoot: true`
- TTL-based cleanup ensures ephemeral resources don't accumulate
- Revision tracking ensures traceability to specific TA definitions
- Kubernetes audit logs correlate directly to executions via per-execution SA names (`zoa-runner-<exec-id>`) and pod labels (`zoa.rosa.io/execution-id`, `zoa.rosa.io/operator`, `zoa.rosa.io/action`)

### Reliability:

- **Scalability**: Stable SAs and ArgoCD-managed infra support thousands of concurrent executions. DynamoDB uses a `status-index` GSI for efficient reconciler queries (no full-table scans)
- **Observability**: DynamoDB provides queryable execution history; S3 stores execution logs and output; ManifestWork status provides real-time job state
- **Resiliency**: Reconciler uses race-safe ordering (delete RB before status update) to prevent stale resources. Per-TA and global timeouts prevent stuck executions. Logs are uploaded unconditionally to S3 before Job exits.
- **Timeout handling**: Executions exceeding their timeout are marked `timed_out` (distinct from `failed`), RB is deleted, and the full duration is recorded

### Cost:

- DynamoDB on-demand pricing (~$1.25/million writes)
- S3 Standard with Intelligent-Tiering transition at 30 days + 365-day expiration (FedRAMP retention)
- 5 Pod Identity associations per cluster (negligible)
- One custom container image build pipeline

### Operability:

- Adding a new TA: create YAML in `argocd/config/regional-cluster/platform-api/ta-templates/`, push, ArgoCD syncs ConfigMap
- Updating the image: change `zoa-job-config` values, ArgoCD syncs, Platform API hot-reloads
- The `zoa-tools` container image and Go CLI live in [`rosa-hyperfleet-zoa`](https://github.com/openshift-online/rosa-hyperfleet-zoa); TA templates will follow
- Adding a new static SA profile: update `zoa-jobs` chart, Terraform (IAM role + Pod Identity), and Platform API (scope mapping)
- Debugging: `zoa logs <id>` → full execution log from S3 (available even after Job/Pod GC, including when the runner Job failed)
